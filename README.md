# RioDBPlugin

www.riodb.org

RioDBPlugin is a java class for developing RioDB Input and Output plugins (which are .jar files). 

RioDBPlugin is not just a helper class. It's a required class because a plugin and RioDB need to pass objects to one another. Therefore, these object classes must be defined (imported) in both programs.
